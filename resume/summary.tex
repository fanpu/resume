  I am currently a student at Carnegie Mellon who is looking to experience interning in a large company after a very productive stint at Saleswhale which provided me the opportunity to see the inner workings of a seed round startup. I am interested to learn software engineering practices in large teams and work on large-scale problems. I have substantial web development experience in production and working in cross-functional teams during my time in Saleswhale. I love startups, DevOps, automating things, and I am a big fan and user of Arch Linux.
