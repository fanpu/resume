  I have experience working on both infrastructure at scale at Asana as well as full-stack systems at Saleswhale. I can work in cross-functional teams, effectively investigate and resolve infrastructure problems by synthesizing logs and metrics from many sources, work autonomously on open-ended problems, and translate product requirements into technical features. I am looking to expand my horizons and step out of my comfort zone by working on challenging problems in systems and infrastructure.
